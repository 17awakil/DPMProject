# DPMProject
The code contained in this repository was written for McGill's ECSE 211 (Design Principles and Methods) Winter 2019. The project, which involves navigating around a map sent to the robot through wifi and finding and classifiyng soda cans, is divided into task-oriented packages, which define the key behaviors for the robot. The code for this project was written by software lead Jacob Silcoff with the help of Helen Lin, Andre Wakil, Youssef Bouaouina, Jed Lamari Saysset, and Yuhang Zhang.
